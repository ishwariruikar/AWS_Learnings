Applications Of AWS
The AWS services are using by both startup and MNC companies as per their usecase. The startup companies are using overcome hardware infrasture cost and applications deployments effectively with cost and performance. Whereas large scale companies are using AWS cloud services for the management of their Infrastructure to completely focus on the development of products widely. The following the Real-world industrial use-cases of AWS services:
Netflix: The Large streaming gaint using AWS for the storage and scaing of the applications for ensuring seamless content delivery with low latency without interruptions to millions of users globally.
Airbnb: By utilizing AWS, Airbnb manages the various workloads and provides insurable and expandable infrastructure for its virtual marketplace and lodging offerings.
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory: It takes the help of AWS services to handle and analyze large-scale volumes of data related to vital scientific research missions and space exploration.
Capital One: A financial Company that is utilizing AWS for its security and compliance while delivering innovative banking services to its customers.

AWS Global Infrastructure
The AWS global infrastructure is massive and is divided into geographical regions. The geographical regions are then divided into separate availability zones. While selecting the geographical regions for AWS, three factors come into play
Optimizing Latency
Reducing cost
Government regulations (Some services are not available for some regions)
Each region is divided into at least two availability zones that are physically isolated from each other, which provides business continuity for the infrastructure as in a distributed system. If one zone fails to function, the infrastructure in other availability zones remains operational. The largest region North Virginia (US-East), has six availability zones. These availability zones are connected by high-speed fiber-optic networking.
There are over 100 edge locations distributed all over the globe that are used for the CloudFront (content delivery network). CloudFront can cache frequently used content such as images and videos(live streaming videos also) at edge locations and distribute it to edge locations across the globe for high-speed delivery and low latency for end-users. It also protects from DDOS attacks.

AWS Management Console
The AWS management console is a web-based interface to access AWS. It requires an AWS account and also has a smartphone application for the same purpose. So When you  sign in for first time, you see the console home page where you see all the services provided by AWS. Cost monitoring is also done through the console.
AWS resources can also be accessed through various Software Development Kits (SDKs), which allows the developers to create applications as AWS as its backend. There are SDKs for all the major languages(e.g., JavaScript, Python, Node.js, .Net, PHP, Ruby, Go, C++). There are mobile SDKs for Android, iOS, React Native, Unity, and Xamarin. AWS can also be accessed by making HTTP calls using the AWS-API. AWS also provides a AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) for remotely accessing the AWS and can implement scripts to automate many processes. This Console is also available as an app for Android and iOS. For mobile apps, you can simply download AWS console app. 

AWS Cloud Computing Models
There are three cloud computing models available on AWS.
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): It is the basic building block of cloud IT. It generally provides access to data storage space, networking features, and computer hardware(virtual or dedicated hardware). It is highly flexible and gives management controls over the IT resources to the developer. For example, VPC, EC2, EBS.
Platform as a Service (PaaS): This is a type of service where AWS manages the underlying infrastructure (usually operating system and hardware). This helps the developer to be more efficient as they do not have to worry about undifferentiated heavy lifting required for running the applications such as capacity planning, software maintenance, resource procurement, patching, etc., and focus more on deployment and management of the applications. For example, RDS, EMR, ElasticSearch.
Software as a Service(SaaS): It is a complete product that usually runs on a browser. It primarily refers to end-user applications. It is run and managed by the service provider. The end-user only has to worry about the application of the software suitable to its needs. For example, Saleforce.com, Web-based email, Office 365.
