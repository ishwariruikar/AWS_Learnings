Day: 12/Feb/23
IP Address
•	A unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network or the internet, acting like a digital address for online communication.
•	Decimal to binary conversion:
o	8 bit = 1 byte
o	128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
•	Example of IP: 4.84.16.64/128 (Numbers up to 1563)
•	If we turn off data, our mobile, Wi-Fi switch, or any device, we lose connection. The assigned IP address will be lost, so when we reconnect, a new IP will be assigned to us.
________________________________________
EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute Cloud)
•	EC2 is a combination of RAM & CPU.
•	We prefer SSD (Solid State Drive) over HDD (Hard Disk Drive).
•	SSD is faster than HDD because SSD contains block-based storage, making it more efficient.
________________________________________
OS (Operating System) [Kernel + GNU Apps]
Kernel
•	It is the core of the OS, acting as an intermediary between hardware & software.
•	Detects the movement of the mouse and any input device.
GNU Apps
•	Collection of free software packages, including applications, libraries, and developer tools.
•	Built-in apps.
________________________________________
Default Port Numbers
•	HTTP: 80
•	HTTPS: 443
•	SSH: 22
________________________________________
Process & Explanation of Launching an EC2 Instance
Step 1: Name
•	Name the instance (keep it simple & related to its work).
•	Example: linux, ubuntu, first
Step 2: OS (AMI - Amazon Machine Image)
•	We need to select any one OS from the list.
o	Examples: Amazon Linux, macOS, Ubuntu, etc.
•	Amazon Linux & Ubuntu are mostly used.
•	Then select the server (make sure to opt for a free one).
Step 3: Instance Type
•	There are many instance types available according to:
o	Our database center
o	CPU needs
o	Memory needs
Step 4: Key Pair (.pem)
•	Key pair is a .pem file which we create.
•	This key pair file acts as a password for our instance.
•	Once we lose our .pem file or key pair, we cannot access the instance again.
•	We can create a new key pair each time we launch an instance, or we can reuse the previous key pair file.
________________________________________
Step 5: Security Group
•	Security group is the step where we can add or remove port numbers.
•	Also, there is an option where we can edit inbound rules.
•	The IP Address 0.0.0.0/0 means it is allowed for everyone.
•	We can edit the port numbers here.
________________________________________
Step 6: Storage
•	8 GB storage is given to each and every instance by default.
________________________________________
Step 7: Number of Instances
•	1 instance is selected by default.
________________________________________
RAM vs. Hard Disk
•	RAM is temporary storage.
•	Hard disk is permanent storage.

Server Setup Diagram (Explanation of Components)
The server is a combination of:
1.	EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): Combination of RAM & CPU.
2.	EBS (Elastic Block Store):
o	SSD for storage can be upgraded up to 64 TB.
o	We can attach more than one.
3.	ENI (Elastic Network Interface):
o	Public & private IPs are assigned to it.
________________________________________
EBS (Elastic Block Store)
•	The first EBS contains OS, and other attached EBS volumes do not contain OS.
•	The EBS with OS is also called Root Volume.
•	We can attach & detach the EBS to another server as well.
________________________________________
ENI (Elastic Network Interface)
•	ENI is of two types: Primary & Secondary.
________________________________________
EC2 States
1.	Start
o	Pending → Running
2.	Stop
o	Stopping → Stopped
3.	Terminate
o	Shutting down → Terminated (Instance deleted)

Linux File & Directory Permissions
Understanding Permissions
•	r → Read
•	w → Write
•	x → Execute
Permission Representation
•	- → Represents a file
•	d → Represents a directory
Managing Permissions with chmod
•	Grant execute permission to a file:
•	chmod +x filename
•	Remove execute permission from a file:
•	chmod -x filename
•	Grant write permission to a file:
•	chmod +w filename
•	Remove write permission from a file:
•	chmod -w filename
•	Grant execute permission to a directory and its contents:
•	chmod -R +x directoryname
________________________________________
Task Example: Creating Yearly Directories
Steps:
1.	Create a directory named Year
2.	mkdir Year
3.	Inside Year, create directories for 2023, 2024, and 2025:
4.	cd Year
5.	mkdir 2023 2024 2025
6.	In 2024, add 12 subdirectories for each month:
7.	cd 2024
8.	mkdir Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec
9.	Copy all month directories from 2024 to 2025:
10.	cp -r 2024/* 2025/
________________________________________
Linux File & Directory Permissions (Advanced Concepts)
Permissions for Directories
1.	Read (r) → Allows listing files inside a directory.
2.	Write (w) → Allows creating or deleting files inside a directory.
3.	Execute (x) → Allows entering the directory.
________________________________________
Granting Permissions to Users, Groups & Others
Using chmod for File & Directory Permissions
•	Grant execute permission to a user:
•	chmod u+x filename
•	Grant execute permission to a group:
•	chmod g+x filename
•	Grant execute permission to others:
•	chmod o+x filename
Setting All Permissions at Once Using Numeric Values
Instead of using multiple commands, you can use numbers:
•	Read (r) = 4
•	Write (w) = 2
•	Execute (x) = 1
Example:
•	chmod 777 filename → Grants full permissions to everyone.
•	chmod 755 filename → Grants full access to owner, read & execute for others.
________________________________________
Recursive Permissions
To apply permissions to all subdirectories and files inside a directory:
chmod -R 755 directoryname
________________________________________
Using echo Command
•	Print text on screen:
•	echo "Hello, World!"
•	Save text to a file:
•	echo "Hello, World!" > filename.txt
________________________________________
File Ownership & Web Servers
Changing File Ownership
•	Change file owner:
•	chown new_owner filename
•	Change owner & group:
•	chown new_owner:new_group filename
________________________________________
Hiding Files in Linux
•	Prefix the filename with a . (dot) to hide it.
•	mv file.txt .file.txt
•	To view hidden files:
•	ls -al
________________________________________
Static vs. Dynamic Websites
Static Website
1.	No database required.
2.	Uses simple languages like HTML, CSS, JS.
3.	Fixed content and layout.
Dynamic Website
1.	Requires a database.
2.	Uses complex languages like PHP, ASP.NET, Servlet, etc..
3.	Content & layout can change dynamically.
________________________________________
Web Servers
•	Apache (Traditional)
•	Nginx (Light & Powerful)
•	Lighttpd
•	Gunicorn (Django & Flask FastAPI)
•	IIS (Internet Information Services)
________________________________________
Ports
•	HTTP: Port 80
•	HTTPS: Port 443

Using Images in a Webpage (Without Downloading)
To display an image in a webpage without downloading it, use the <img> tag in your HTML file:
<img src="image_link" />
This method allows the webpage to load images directly from the internet instead of storing them on your server.
________________________________________
SCP (Secure Copy Protocol)
Steps for SCP (Transferring Files Securely)
SCP is used for uploading images, videos, or files from a Windows desktop to a server.
Command to Upload a File to Server:
scp -i key.pem Desktop/filename ec2-user@public-ip:/path/to/destination
•	scp: Secure copy command
•	-i key.pem: Specifies the SSH key
•	Desktop/filename: The file on your local machine
•	ec2-user@public-ip:/path/to/destination: Destination on the server
________________________________________

________________________________________
Downloading Images to Webpage from the Internet
1.	Copy Image URL
o	Find the direct link to the image.
2.	Use wget to Download Image
